<p>The air felt cold. The wind unwelcoming. The sky cloudy. The ground wet. The way ahead foggy. The only sound that could be heard is that of feet rythmicly connecting with the concrete path in the country side forest. A tall well built middle aged man in a dark hoody and jogging shorts could be seen.</p>
<p>Running had become a way of release from his everyday job infront of the computer. His mind would find freedom to process information he had been accumulating. The mind always needed time to deal with all the accumulation. He would let his thoughts flow freely and observing them. Occasionally, old memories would resurface and he could only painfully smile and accept them.</p>
<p>&#39;Why does life have to be such a pain&#39; Byron frowned as sweat dropped from his face even through the cold weather. The forest ended and he entered a barren farmland region. Crows infested the farms ironically searching for whatever was left over.</p>
<p>&quot;Caw caw&quot; a nearby crow cawed watching Byron with it&#39;s pitch black eyes. &#39;Such intelligent creatures. I&#39;d adopt one if I ever get the chance&#39; he thought.</p>
<p>After arriving back to his apartment located at the outskirts of the small city he lived in, he took a long and warm shower before having a quick lunch. He took out his phone, placed it on the kitchen counter top and started listening to the latest news while preparing some food.</p>
<p>&quot;Hello GladSeason here, in just a few days Path of God will be releasing live. For those that have been living under a rock for the past 5 years, PoG is a new MMORPG unlike any of its predecessors and developped by Tempest Gaming Studios. Tempest has given little to no information regarding any of the content that can be expected, however it features a complete immersive experience using it&#39;s new deep dive technology. Yes, that&#39;s right you&#39;ll literally be in the game, well atleast your mind will be. Remember the game can only be accessed during sleeping hours while asleep. Ironic right? According to the information we have here, it&#39;ll feel much like a dream. Though... questionable decisions have been made regarding the game and by the late Dr. Oduf who insisted in making it incompantible with recording and streaming software.&quot;</p>
