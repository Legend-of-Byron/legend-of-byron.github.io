<p>The air felt cold. The wind unwelcoming. The sky cloudy. The ground wet. The way ahead foggy. The only sound that could be heard is that of feet rythmicly connecting with the concrete path in a gloomy forest. A tall well built middle aged man in a dark hoody and jogging shorts could be seen. Others may dislike such weather but it felt unnaturaly comforting for this man. </p>
<p>Running had become a way of release from his everyday computer engineering job. His mind would find freedom to process information he had been accumulating. Old memories would occasionally resurface and he would grimace at them, momentarily losing concentration.</p>
<p>&#39;Life is not easy. We struggle our whole lives for mear scraps.&#39; Byron frowned as sweat started dripping even through the cold weather. The forest ended and he entered a barren farmland region. Crows infested the farms ironically searching for whatever was left over.</p>
<p>&quot;Caw caw&quot; some crows went after seeing him. &#39;Such intelligent creatures, having a scavenger like mentality is definitely the way to survive in a harsh environment&#39;.</p>
<p>After arriving back to his apartment located at the outskirts of the small city he lived in, he took a shower before having lunch. He took out his phone, placed it on the kitchen counter top and started listening to the latest news while preparing some food.</p>
<p>&quot;[...] You&#39;re absolutely right John, there&#39;s only a minority left that still remain unprotected. The minister has decided to take the ncessary actions to [...]&quot; the presentator said before Byron annoyingly changed the video.</p>
<p>&quot;[...] Path of God, using the new Deep Dive Technology (DDT), will be coming out tonight at midnight. [...]&quot; </p>
<p>&#39;Now, we&#39;re talking&#39; Byron thought while listened attentively and felt deep excitement for the announcement. He had been actively following up on any news regarding this game. It had been in development for years by a discreet company called Tempest and finally after extreme patience they announced a release date six months ago.</p>
<p>Byron always held great respect for Tempest. They were privately owned and self funded which was something of a breath of fresh air to extremely greedy gaming companies. The gaming industry had been expanding quickly, becoming a trillion dollar industry. A trillion dollar industry with no proper games.</p>
<p>After lunch, Byron went to his room. Inside he had recently had installed the new DDTSD.</p>
