<p>&#39;This place again..?&#39; he frowned while taking in the suroundings.</p>
<p>Since the announce of the major release of a new deep dive MMORPG called Path of God, he had been lucky enough to have been selected for the ALPHA program. The company responsible for the creation of this game had sent him a special human sized pod.</p>
