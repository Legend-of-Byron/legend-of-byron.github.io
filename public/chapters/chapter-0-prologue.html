<p>&quot;Caw caw&quot;</p>
<p>Byron slowly opened his eyes to find himself in a familiar dark dream like world. He stood at the rocky shore infront of the entrance to a gloomy forest. The strong wind ceasely blowing and the rain pounding the earth. The sound of thunder occasionally going off in the distance.</p>
<p>&#39;This place again..?&#39; he frowned while taking in the suroundings. It had been the second time entering this same world.</p>
<p>Since the announce of the major release of a new deep dive MMORPG called Path of God, he had been lucky enough to have been selected for the closed pre-alpha program. After signing the NDA, the company responsible for the creation of this game had sent him a special human sized pod. The pod connects the player&#39;s mind to the game network, allowing access to the game in a dream state. The company announced that this method allowed player&#39;s to enjoy a 1:2 game time ratio. One hour in the real world would be two hours in the game world.</p>
<p>The world went in an uproar when the announcement was made.</p>
<p>Contrary to popular belief, this version of prototype pod didn&#39;t connect to the game. Instead it facilitates a concept called lucid dreaming. Essentially, allowing the user to be aware that they are in dream.</p>
<p>The possibilities of this new technology was endless.</p>
<p>Byron snapped back to reality and glanced at his body.</p>
<p>&#39;Looks like I have the same medeival like leather outfit on&#39; he thought. </p>
<p>Last time the experience had only lasted a few minutes. To ensure the safety of the player, the pod ended the session after a short period of time. This time he could enjoy an hour within the dream world. However, to his suprise he found himself in the same exact place. </p>
<p>Since there was no where else to go Byron decided to enter the forest. The further he entered the thicker the fur and pine trees would get. The eery sounds of crows nearby gave him shivers.</p>
