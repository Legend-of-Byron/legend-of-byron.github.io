<h2 id="prologue">Prologue</h2>
<p>&quot;Caw caw&quot;</p>
<p>Byron slowly opened his eyes to find himself in a familiar dark dream like world. He stood at the rocky shore infront of the entrance to a gloomy forest. The strong wind ceasely blowing and the rain pounding the earth. The sound of thunder occasionally going off in the distance.</p>
<p>&#39;This place again..?&#39; he smiled nervously while taking in the suroundings. It had been the second time entering this same world.</p>
<p>Since the announce of the major release of a new deep dive MMORPG called Path of God, he had been lucky enough to have been selected for the closed pre-alpha program. After signing the NDA, the company responsible for the creation of this game had sent him a special human sized pod. The pod connects the player&#39;s mind to the game network, allowing access to the game in a dream state. The company announced that this method allowed player&#39;s to enjoy a 1:2 game time ratio. One hour in the real world would be two hours in the game world.</p>
<p>The world went in an uproar when the announcement was made.</p>
<p>Contrary to popular belief, this version of prototype pod didn&#39;t connect to the game. Instead it facilitates a concept called lucid dreaming. Essentially, allowing the user to be aware that they are in dream.</p>
<p>The possibilities of this new technology were endless.</p>
<p>Byron snapped back to reality and glanced at his body.</p>
<p>&#39;Looks like I have the same medeival like leather outfit on&#39; he thought. A round wooden shield in his left hand and a crude iron axe in his right. He had long black hair.</p>
<p>[Author note: Take more time to describe how the MC looks like]</p>
<p>Last time the experience had only lasted a few minutes. To ensure the safety of the player, the pod ended the session after a short period of time. This time he could enjoy an hour within the dream world. However, to his suprise he found himself in the same exact place. </p>
<p>Byron strode forward with a firm decision to explore this black forest. The further he entered the thicker the fur and pine trees would get. The eery sounds of crows nearby with the endless cold and wet environment gave him shivers.</p>
<p>Up ahead in the distance on a large slab stood a dark figure. Byron could barely make out the figure but could make out a pair of blue eyes before vanishing entirely and reappearing in front of him.</p>
<p>A dagger seemlessly coming out from under this strangers coat went straight for Byron&#39;s chest. Byron wide eyed didn&#39;t have enough time to react before it plunged into his heart. The figure grabbed Byron by the back of his head and got right up to his ear.</p>
<p>&quot;Welcome back&quot; he smirked evilly as his eyes turned unnaturaly red.</p>
<p>Byron confused tried frantically grabbing at anything with his remaining energy. The world grew dark.</p>
<p>&#39;System notification: you have died&#39; message appeared floating infront of him.</p>
<p>&quot;End session&quot; Byron muttered weakly while standing in a black world.</p>
<p>The pod opened and Byron stepped out to find himself in his room. He wiped the cold sweat off his face.</p>
<p>&#39;What the hell was that&#39; he thought trying to slow down his heart beat. </p>
<p>&#39;I hadn&#39;t seen anyone else within the closed community mentioning such an experience. What an insane experience!&#39;</p>
